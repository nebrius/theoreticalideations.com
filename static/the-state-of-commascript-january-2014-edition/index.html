            <p>Ever since I first announced <a title="Introducing CommaScript: statically typed JavaScript without the fuss" href="http://theoreticalideations.com/2013/08/07/introducing-commascript-statically-typed-javascript-without-the-fuss/">CommaScript</a> back in August of 2013, I've been working on getting the first implementation finished. It's a reasonably large project, so I'm not done yet, but I am making progress. Most of the syntax has been defined, and about two thirds of the analyzer is implemented.</p>

<p>Primitives are the furthest ahead since they form the building blocks of everything else. As it turns out, the syntax is even simpler than I first anticipated: there is no syntax :).</p>

<p>In CommaScript, the <code>var</code> keyword works just like the <code>auto</code> keyword in C++/11 or the <code>var</code> keyword in C# (I think Java recently added something similar, but I haven't been keeping up with Java lately). The key difference, of course, is that there is no typed alternative to <code>var</code> in JavaScript (and thus CommaScript), unlike C++ or C# with <code>int</code>, <code>char</code>, etc.  This means that all <code>var</code> expressions must have a resolvable type on the right hand side in CommaScript.</p>

<p>For primitives, this is actually really simple, since all primitive literals have an inherent type (a string is obviously a string, and obviously not a number, or object, and so on). Primitives also have mechanisms for converting to other primitive types (<code>toString()</code>, <code>toValue()</code>, <code>!!</code>, etc). This means that there isn't any information that needs to be inferred that isn't already there in JavaScript syntax.</p>

<p>Most of the implementation behind primitives is finished as well. The only thing missing is a few expressions (mostly unary expressions). This means that all sorts of expressions are possible today. The following parses correctly:</p>

<pre><code class="language-JavaScript">'use commascript';

var foo = true;  
foo = false;  
</code></pre>

<p>as does:</p>

<pre><code class="language-JavaScript">'use commascript';

var w = 0,  
    x = true,
    y = 10,
    z = 20;

w = x ? y : z + 20;  
</code></pre>

<p>And the following correctly throws an error:</p>

<pre><code class="language-JavaScript">'use commascript';

var x = 0;

x = 10 * 'hello';  
</code></pre>

<p>I also have functions fully implemented. Functions cannot be fully inferred, however, so they need to be declared ahead of time. There are two ways to do this: via function expressions or function declarations. Function expressions are more explicit, and a bit easier to read, but also more verbose.</p>

<pre><code class="language-JavaScript">'use commascript';

('define(function,foo)', {});

var foo = ('cast(foo)', function () {});  
</code></pre>

<p>The other is a function definition, which shortcuts some of the more explicit nature of function expressions:</p>

<pre><code class="language-JavaScript">'use commascript';

('define(function,foo)', {
  returnType: 'string',
  argumentTypes: ['string', 'number']
});

function foo(a, b) {  
  var x = 'str',
      y = 10;
  x = a;
  y = b;
  return x;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Objects are about half way defined. Object literals are supported, but constructors/prototypes are not.</p>

<pre><code class="language-JavaScript">('define(object,foo)', {
  properties: {
    'bar': 'string',
    'baz': 'number'
  }
});

var obj = ('cast(foo)', null);  
obj = {  
  'bar': 'hello world',
  'baz': 10
};
obj.bar = 'goodbye';  
obj.baz = 20;  
</code></pre>

<p>Arrays are not supported at all yet.</p>

<p>So that's where CommaScript is at these days. Making progress, but still a ways to go.</p>
