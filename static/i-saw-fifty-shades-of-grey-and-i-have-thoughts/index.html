  <p>I hadn’t originally planned on watching Fifty Shades of Grey. I knew going in that its depictions of sex and kink were problematic, that its production had been troubled, and that the reviews were unkind, to say the least. But I wasn’t expecting it to do nearly as well at the box office as it is, bringing in over $300 million to date worldwide.</p>
  
  <p>I don’t subscribe to the belief that you must have seen a film, or played a game, or read a book in order to criticize it. The reasons why are enough to fill a blog post on their own (note to self), so I won’t go into them here. However, I was curious to see what the draw is. Just why, exactly, is it so popular? I had my hypotheses, but I wanted to know for certain.</p>
