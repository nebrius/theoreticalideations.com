        <section class="post-content">
            <p>I have decided to leave Wordpress and switch to using <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost Blog</a>. I have been considering the move for some time, but had been holding out for Ghost blog to get more fleshed out. I have long known that Wordpress isn't very secure, but <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2014/03/more-than-162000-legit-wordpress-sites-abused-in-powerful-ddos-attack/">recent events</a> have prompted me to move a little faster than I had planned.</p>

<p>Why does Wordpress suck at security so much? It's not that the devs are terrible, it's just that it's written in PHP. Why is PHP so terrible? I think that Jeff Atwood summed it up perfectly in his post <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-php-singularity/">The PHP Singularity</a>. In more visual terms, PHP is this:</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/uploads/2012/06/6a0120a85dcdae970b017742d249d5970d-800wi.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/uploads/2012/06/6a0120a85dcdae970b017742d249d5970d-800wi.jpg" width="502" height="370"></a></p>

<p>Until the transition is complete, this blog will be put in read-only mode. This means that you can still read the blog, but will be unable to comment, subscribe, etc. Once the transition is complete in the next 24-48 hours, it should switch over automatically for you without any downtime (if I do everything properly).</p>
