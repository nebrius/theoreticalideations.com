            <p>You may have noticed that things have been kinda quite around here lately. Well, I've moved to Medium for my blogging. This is mostly because I can really increase my reach there compared to my own self-hosted blog.</p>

<p>That said, I have a lot of content here that I'm rather fond of, so I'm going to keep this site up in parallel. I will be cross-posting everything from Medium to here going forward. Admittedly I have posted a handful already and forgot to cross-post, but I'll be good about it going forward.</p>
