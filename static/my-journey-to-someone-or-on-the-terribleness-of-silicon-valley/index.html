  <p>Last week, I gave a talk at ForwardJS, and it seemed to be pretty well received. This was the first time I gave a “soft” talk not directly about anything code related. It is also a pretty personal talk, so I was very nervous, to say the least. But I’m glad I did it. I feel very motivated to keep talking about this, and even obligated to talk about it, if that makes any sense.</p>
