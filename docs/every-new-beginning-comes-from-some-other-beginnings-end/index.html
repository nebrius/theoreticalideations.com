        <section class="post-content">
            <p>I haven't posted in a while because I have been extremely busy lately. I have left Appcelerator and am starting a new job soon. I can't say where just yet, but I am <em>very </em>excited about my new position. I will make a formal announcement in two weeks, so stay tuned.</p>

<p>This is a big change for me. I graduated in 2010 and started working later that year at Particle Code, which was then acquired by Appcelerator in 2011. In a way, this is only my second job out of college. It's exciting, but has also been a bit of an adventure getting here.</p>

<p>When I left Appcelerator, it was the first time I had ever truly quit a job. Before this, there were life events that necessitated leaving my pre-career jobs (started college in a new city, couldn't keep my high school part time job, etc), but never before had I just <em>quit.</em> It was a new experience...excitement twinged with more than just a little melancholy.</p>

<p>I think that Appcelerator is going to be very successful, and I wish everyone there all the luck in the world. I will miss the friends that I made there over the years, but I take solace in the knowledge that Silicon Valley is a small place and I will see them again.</p>

<p>I am very excited about where I am going next. This company is known for being a great place to work, and the company's vision is aligns with my own interests and passions much more than Appcelerator did. I can't wait to see what the future holds!</p>
