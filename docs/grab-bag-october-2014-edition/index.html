            <p>I have been swamped lately and haven't really had a chance to post anything, so here's a random assortment of things:  </p>

<ul>  
    <li>Last weekend, I ran the mini San Jose Rock N Roll marathon. It was a lot of fun, and is something I definitely want to do again. Unfortunately, my knee is having some issues. I went to an orthopedic surgeon this morning, and he suspects it's a torn meniscus :( I'll find out for certain on Monday.</li>
    <li>The game <a href="http://thefullbrightcompany.com/gonehome/">Gone Home</a> is absolutely brilliant! I'm still thinking about it even though it's been a month since I played it.</li>
    <li>I more recently played the first two acts of <a href="http://kentuckyroutezero.com/">Kentucky Route Zero</a>, and so far I absolutely adore it! Reminds me of David Lynch a bit. I can't wait to see where it goes.</li>
    <li>Gravity, by Alfonso Cuar√≥n, is incredible. If you haven't seen it, see it now! Orbital mechanics issues aside, the film is stunning. Hands down the best performance I've ever seen from Sandra Bullock. I foresee an Oscar nomination for her.</li>
    <li>My partner in crime at Appcelerator, <a href="http://www.ambientreality.com/">Chris Barber</a>, recently pointed me to <a href="http://css-tricks.com/animation-css-triangles-work/">this CSS-trick</a> for creating triangles using pure CSS. Awesome!</li>
    <li>I'm working on a new web interface for my aquarium that will show a lot more info and have a lot more configurability. It's going to use <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation</a>, <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/">Handlebars.js</a>, and <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone.js</a>. Why? Cause my efforts thus far have used <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Boostrap</a>, <a href="http://mustache.github.io/">Mustache</a>, and (on occasion) <a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember.js</a>. So in other words, it's a thinly veiled excuse to learn new things :).</li>
    <li>I signed up for <a href="http://www.jseverywhere.org/">JS.everywhere(2013)</a>, which should be fun. I'm especially looking forward to the JS in Research talk.</li>
    <li>I am (very) slowly but surely making progress on <a title="Introducing CommaScript: statically typed JavaScript without the fuss" href="http://theoreticalideations.com/2013/08/07/introducing-commascript-statically-typed-javascript-without-the-fuss/">Commascript</a>. All of the definition and cast operations have been fleshed out, except for arrays, and I'm working on fleshing out return type checking in functions.</li>
