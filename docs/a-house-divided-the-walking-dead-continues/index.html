            <p>Episode 2 of season 2 of Telltale Game's The Walking Dead was just released last week, and I finally had a chance to play it. I won't go into it in-depth like I did <a title="Clementine's Story: The Walking Dead Season 2" href="http://theoreticalideations.com/2013/12/23/clementines-story-the-walking-dead-season-2/">the last episode</a>, partly because the previous episode established much of what occurred in this episode, and partly because much of my thoughts on that episode apply to this one as well.</p>

<p>There wasn't as much "new" in this episode, but that is actually a good thing. In retrospect, I realize that the previous episode was actually a little stilted due to having to introduce so much so fast, and some of the characters came off a little shallow. Not so in this episode. Telltale knocked this one out of the park, and it is, in my opinion, one of the best episodes of both seasons.</p>
