<p>I have been at JSConf US this last week, and I can safely say it is the best conference I've ever been to! I have so many ideas swirling around in my head I don't know where to start! Even more than that though is the people. JSConf titled this years conference "The 5th Year Family Reunion," and this isn't just a marketing slogan. There was a palpable sense of community at this event that I have never seen before. I met so many amazing people from all over; from key people at major tech companies to independent developers just starting out.</p>

<p>There is one thing that we all had in common though: we were all passionate about JavaScript. The amount of passion I saw is something I've never seen before. I didn't meet anyone that was just there for a free trip, or because their employer made them go, or because it was better than a day in the office, which is common at the local conferences in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>

<p>The primary organizers behind the conference, Chris Williams (<a href="https://twitter.com/voodootikigod">@voodootikigod</a>) and Laura Williams (<a href="https://twitter.com/lwilliams">@lwilliams</a>), have created something truly special. There is a focus on making the community stronger. It's not just about the talks, although they were incredible, or the events, which were also amazing, but about creating an experience that encourages people to come together and create amazing things.</p>

<p>I'm going to release three blog posts over the next few days talking about the three days at the conference. Each day was completely unique, and each contributed in its own way to making the conference what it was, so stay tuned!</p>
